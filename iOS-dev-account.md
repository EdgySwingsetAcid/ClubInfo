# Gaining access to the club's iOS developer account

1. Email me at vandersc@onid.oregonstate.edu with your onid email account
    * You will recieve an invitation to that email address soon after
2. Register yourself with an Apple ID and accept the invitation
3. Open your Xcode->Preferences->Accounts and login with the same account as above
4. Open your Xcode project/workspace and change the team to Oregon State University under the General tab
5. Open Window->Organizer->Devices with your device plugged into your computer. Copy the Device ID and send an email to osuappclub@gmail.com
    * Indicate in your email why you need the account (ie App Club Bus Hackathon)
6. Run your project on your device and select Fix Issue when the popup appears
    * You will have to wait until you are approved

7. Once both step 5 & 6 have been approved, you will now be able to run your app on your device

Happy coding,
Chris
