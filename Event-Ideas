During the winter term we will try to more events rather than regular meetings.


Here is a list of ideas:

* Quadcopter (Flying Benny the Beaver)
* Beaglebone/Pi app connections
* Transportation app with public policy department
* Hardware stuff (GPS, GPU, Accelerator, Gyro, Camera, Bluetooth, Barometer)
* Puzzle Night (Really good for interviews)
* App for local buisness (Variety of places: including new copy store)
* Coding game events organized by [Felicity](http://felicity.iiit.ac.in/threads) during Winter 2014.  There is even a hardware challenge!
