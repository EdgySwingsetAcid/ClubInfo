Teams will work to create an app (Android, iOS, Titanium, or Mobile web) that gives information about the Corvallis bus system (CTS). Teams should be ~4 people **Any app skill level** is encouraged to RSVP. 
For those of you that made it to the Google Hackathon, this will be a perfect way to use your new Google Maps skills. If you do not have a group, we will pair you with a team ahead of time. Please brainstorm ideas on what you think a bus app should be. Food, snacks and prizes will be provided.
