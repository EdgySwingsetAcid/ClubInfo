Microsoft Coding Competition (10/25)
============================

* Microsoft has offered to host a coding competition, complete with free food and drinks, for the app club. The competition would be a friday (10/25) for ~4 hours. I think it would be a good experience for club members to interact and get a programming experience.
* Note: I will make sure this is open to anyone (programming wizard, computer science 1st year, biology major, etc.) so all should come if they can.
* Doodle poll for best times: To-be-created
